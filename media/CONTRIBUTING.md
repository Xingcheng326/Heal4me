# Contributing

## Overview
The Heal4Me team always welcomes new contributors to the project! Everyone, from all different backgrounds and expertise, are encouraged to contribute. Whether you can provide the platform with another language, have professional knowledge in the fields related to our user base, or are someone who is learning to code, and trying to gain experience, we want everyone passionate about our mission and/or willing to contribute to our platform to come join our project. We are here to help find you your perfect role and get you excited about working on the Heal4Me team.


## Tools and Learning Resources (For Technical Contributors)
Regardless of your background, if you are looking for a technical role, we will provide you with the necessary resources to get you going. For now, here are some helpful videos and concepts. 

### Important Topic and Concepts to Learn
**If applicable, get familiar with the following tools, technologies, and languages** <br/>
* MERN Stack: a JavaScript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. It consists of the following four technologies: 
  * **M**ongoDB
  * **E**xpressJS
  * **R**eactJS
  * **N**odeJS
* Our use of the MERN Stack requires familiarity with the following:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
 
### Learning Resources
If you do not have any familiarity with these technologies, we prepared a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPgx4r0FGixm5SZqE6KEPt9n8oLqFi57h), which provides you with a free collection of 30 recommended videos that make great learning resources. Feel free to start the playlist from your current level of expertise. We start from the very basics (HTML and CSS), followed by JavaScript, followed by the components of the MERN Stack, and lastly, the full stack itself. In between the free courses, there are quick video summaries, which can be used as a refresher, if you ever get lost. Alternatively, if you are willing to pay for a learning service, we find this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/) course to be very useful.

### Getting Started
To setup your environment and get everything running, check out this [article](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-2-637f337e5d61).

If there is any confusion, or perhaps you are absolutely new to coding, get in contact with the team, and we would love to introduce you to the absolute basics, including the command line, Git, issue tracking, and any other technologies we may have missed. 

### Running the application

To begin, clone the repository into a directory of your choice. Navigate into SocialNetwork/ and run `npm i` to install backend dependencies. After installation has completed, navigate inside client/ and run `npm i` again to install frontend dependencies. Finally, in SocialNetwork/ you can now enter `npm run dev` to start the app. In order for python dependent features, such as recommendations to work, you will additionally need to go to SocialNetwork/recommender and run `pip install` to get nltk, pandas, numpy, sklearn, keras, and tensorflow. Using the dev script, as before, should now allow you to view any ML-generated content.

## Motivation
We want to help people struggling with mental illnesses. According to the world health organization, [Around 450 million people currently suffer from mental health disorders](https://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/). We are here to provide help to these individuals in need. Whether our users cannot afford therapy and medication, are not comfortable approaching medical professionals in person, or want to enhance their current treatments, Heal4Me is here to deliver on those wishes.

**Some videos for inspiration** <br/>
* A very awesome YouTube Channel, [Special Books by Special Kids](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4E98HDsPXrf5kTKIgrSmtQ/videos), often interviews children struggling with mental illnesses (as well as other disabilities), and is a great channel to learn about the struggles that many people with mental illnesses face, and why Heal4Me could not only provide them with the resources to feel better (and be better), but also the tools for them to form more friendships with others.
* The YouTube video linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHiqqpSQjV8) is very moving, and the experiences of the individuals in the video may help you to better sympathize with the many people struggling with mental illnesses, around the world.
* This [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieXB-BGxYwg) discusses how common mental illnesses truly are, and how people can succeed, despite them. Hopefully, this video can prove the importance of more mental health resources, like Heal4Me, as well as share newer approaches to helping others with mental illnesses.
