# What is Heal4Me?

## The Run-Down
Heal4Me is an online platform, focused on providing its users with the tools they need to fight mental illnesses. We aim to create a semi-anonymous social network that's more comfortable, accessible, and/or affordable (free!) than in-person group meetings or therapy. We're always around to help!

While Heal4Me is predominantly a crowd-sourced mental health support forum, akin to a virtual 24/7 Alcoholics Anonymous, our defining feature lies in our personalized recommendation algorithm. Using our algorithm, users can browse suggested groups and posts, and explore a variety of resources from books to meditation tutorials.
